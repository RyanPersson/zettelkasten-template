# reccomended-extensions

connected to [[make-zet-portable]]

PRobably should set up zet as docker container with vscode with reccomended extensions.

List:
tchayen.markdown-links (in remote) (graph extension)
kortina.vscode-markdown-notes (in remote) (wiki links & backlinks [tags too supposedly? #todo find out how this uses tags])
thomaskoppelaar.markdown-wiki-links-preview (in remote) (enables wiki links in preview mode)
sakamoto66.vscode-paste-image (in local side) (allows pasting images via `ctrl+alt+v`)

#todo make previews light mode
#todo make jupyter notebooks light mode



Vim. (you like it personally, probably not good to install for all users.)

Possibly apply this setting?        "vim.startInInsertMode" : true,

Edited list.focusDown & list.focusUp in vscode global user settings.
